# Score Manager

## What will the application do?
This is a score management system for independent/freelancing composers to manage their scores more easily. 
It will allow the user to add scores into their collection, view the entire collection, display the detail of 
each score, and rate the difficulty. 

## Who will use it?
Ideally used by **independent/freelancing composers**

## Why is this project of interest to you?
As a composer, I tend to spend lots of time organizing my scores, especially when I have to retrieve
information of certain scores for my CV or grant applications. Thus, I thought it'd be interesting to focus on 
solving this problem using my first Java application/project.
